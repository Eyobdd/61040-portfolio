# About Me

_My name is Eyob Davidoff, I'm a senior studying computer science at Harvard and 6.1040 is the first class I've taken at MIT!_

Some fun facts about me:

1. In my spare time I like doing jigsaw puzzles.
2. I love Basketball and my favourite basketball team is the Sacramento Kings(even though I'm from Canada).
3. I took a gap year after my sophomore year of college to teach highschool students to code!
