# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains

### Brainstorm

<details>
<summary>Click to expand brainstorm ideas</summary>

1. **Personal Reflection & Habit-Building**  
   I care about regular reflection but run into friction: remembering to journal, carving out the time, and not having a quick way to review past entries or pull higher-level insights from them. Writing often feels like an extra task. I want a lightweight, structured way to capture thoughts daily and see patterns over time without it feeling like another task.

2. **Student-to-Student Campus Exchange**  
   At Harvard, students often use dorm email lists and send slide decks of items to sell, which creates a flood of “spammy” emails at the start and end of terms. They do this because trading with other Harvard students feels safer and easier than Facebook Marketplace. I’d like a campus-bounded way to discover, vet, and exchange items quickly—without inbox overload.

3. **Using Shared Dorm Amenities Without Guesswork**  
   Harvard recently switched to the _On Tap Away_ app to manage laundry, but it misses the mark: it doesn’t address the trial-and-error timing problem, especially when our building has just six machines (3 washers & 3 dryers) for 70+ people. I want earlier, more actionable signals about availability so I can plan my time instead of gambling it.

4. **Coordinating Casual Social Meals**  
   I love spontaneous meals with friends, but lining up time and place is harder than it should be. Group chats sprawl and good intentions fizzle. I want a simple, low-friction way to surface availability and interest without back-and-forth.

5. **Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms**  
   I’m interested in pedagogy and have seen peer-to-peer activities help, but pairing and facilitation are often ad-hoc. Beyond helping teachers set up effective pairs/groups, I want to enable researchers to access large-scale classroom data so the impact of different pedagogies can actually be measured.

6. **Sharing Learning Artifacts Among Students**  
   Classes generate tons of notes and summaries, yet high-quality material is scattered and hard to trust. Motivated students produce great resources that don’t travel. I want a reliable way to find, credit, and iteratively improve study materials.

7. **Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships**  
   I genuinely like hanging out and staying in touch, but in the hustle and bustle I forget to maintain relationships or they fall off my radar. I want gentle structure to keep friendships top-of-mind with supportive nudges.

8. **Discovering & Enrolling in Enrichment Programs**  
   Families struggle to find after-school and summer options; information is fragmented and popular programs fill fast. The search and waitlist process feels opaque. I want clearer discovery and enrollment paths, especially for oversubscribed programs.

9. **Learning User Research by Doing**  
   When students hear about user interviews the rarely are able to practice under realistic conditions. During my gap year I taught user research as a way to explore the world and build user-centric solutions; a tool here could expand that reach and give teachers a creative on-ramp to design thinking. I want experiential practice with feedback that connects insights to solution quality and viability.

10. **Teacher-to-Teacher Curriculum Sharing & Adaptation**  
    Teachers reinvent materials constantly, yet good resources are hard to find, vet, and adapt. Inspired by Scratch’s "Remix" culture - communities that iterate, learn, and share - I want materials to travel and evolve with clear attribution and quality signals.

### Most Promising

<details>

#### **Personal Reflection & Habit-Building**

I find it genuinely helpful to take a moment each day to reflect on what happened and plan what I want to do tomorrow. But there’s real friction: I sometimes forget to journal, when I’m busy it’s one of the first habits I abandon because it “takes too much time,” and with a written journal it’s hard to spot high-level patterns across days. I’m curious whether new AI tools could lower the effort of reflection and still unlock the benefits, like actionable to-dos and higher-level insights, without the usual pain.

#### **Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms**

I’m deeply interested in education and pedagogy, and I’ve seen peer activities help; however, pairing and facilitation often feel ad-hoc, especially in under-resourced classrooms. I’m drawn to this domain because it’s hard for educators and researchers to access enough real-world data to evaluate which approaches work best at scale. I want to understand how to support peer learning more intentionally and make it easier to study its impact rigorously.

#### **Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships**

I care about staying close with people I value - meeting up, calling, FaceTiming, or even sending a quick “thinking of you” text - but in the rush of school and life, relationships slip out of focus. The friction is remembering who I haven’t connected with recently and finding low-effort ways to reach out that feel natural, not performative or guilt-inducing. I’m interested in light weight scaffolds that keep relationships top-of-mind and make it easier to initiate and sustain meaningful touchpoints.

## Problems

### Domain Problems

<details>
<summary><b>Personal Reflection & Habit-Building (Domain 1)</b></summary>

- **1.1) Reflection slips when I’m busy**  
  On most evenings I want to reflect and plan tomorrow, but when school ramps up I forget or skip it because it feels like it takes too much time. I’ve tried reminders and a few apps. I still end up inconsistent and lose the thread from day to day. I want a way to make reflection easy to remember and quick to complete so the habit sticks.
- **1.2) Hard to see patterns across entries**  
  I journal for stretches, but when I look back it’s hard to spot themes—what drains me, what works, how goals progress. I’ve tried tags and rereads, but it still feels like noise. I want clearer trends that translate into simple next steps.
- **1.3) Digital journaling doesn’t lower friction (and can distract)**  
 I prefer handwriting to typing, and digitizing doesn’t actually reduce the effort; it often adds negatives—like typing on my phone before bed, which feels awkward and distracting. Re-entering notes or forcing myself to type just shifts the burden without making reflection easier. I want the benefits of digital insight without adding typing friction or device distraction.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms(Domain 5)</b></summary>

- **5.1) Forming effective pairs without data**  
  When I run peer activities, I often have little to go on beyond a roster, so pairing ends up random or based on guesswork. Quick surveys and ad-hoc observations still take time and give uneven results. I want a lightweight way to form complementary pairs quickly so the activity starts strong.
- **5.2) Classroom workflow slows the activity**  
  During Think-Pair-Share–style tasks, I juggle slides, rosters, and timers, which costs minutes and breaks momentum. Spreadsheets and printed lists still pull focus from facilitation. I want smoother in-the-moment logistics so students spend more time actually collaborating.
- **5.3) Hard to capture outcomes at scale**  
  After activities, it’s difficult to collect consistent, low-burden signals about what worked—across classes, weeks, or schools. Exit tickets and small pilots produce fragmented, small datasets. I want a simple, ethical way to gather comparable outcome data so different pedagogies can be evaluated rigorously.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships (Domain 7)</b></summary>

- **7.1) Losing track of recent contact**  
  Even with good intentions, weeks can pass without reaching out. Lists and calendar reminders help only a little, and outreach remains reactive. A gentle way to surface who has fallen off the radar would make staying in touch easier.
- **7.2) No clear sense of weekly social bandwidth**  
  Without a realistic view of time and energy for connection, it’s easy to overcommit or under-connect. Calendars don’t translate into a simple “capacity” for calls, texts, or meetups. A straightforward capacity view would align plans with actual bandwidth.
- **7.3) No differentiation of connectedness levels**  
  Treating all contacts the same makes it hard to prioritize relationships that matter most or need attention now. A lightweight way to reflect different closeness levels would help right-size touchpoints and timing.

</details>

### Selected Problems

<details>
<summary><b>Reflection slips when I’m busy (Problem 1.1)</b></summary>

When school ramps up, reflection gets skipped because it feels time-consuming and easy to forget. This is widespread and directly tied to my experience; without consistency, none of the downstream benefits (insights, planning) happen. It’s also tractable to prototype and evaluate quickly, which makes it a strong fit for a short project.  
**Why included:** High impact, personal salience, clear MVP, measurable behavior change.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hard to see patterns across entries (Problem 1.2)</b></summary>

Even with intermittent journaling, it’s difficult to surface themes like repeated stressors, effective routines, or progress toward goals. Improving this turns reflection into actionable adjustments rather than isolated entries. It pairs naturally with 1.1 but remains a distinct, solvable problem.  
**Why included:** Converts reflection into action; strong leverage; evaluable via simple metrics (e.g., surfaced trends → next-step tasks).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Digital journaling doesn’t lower friction (and can distract) (Problem 1.3) </b></summary>

Typing—especially on a phone before bed—adds its own friction and can be distracting, so “just digitize it” isn’t actually a fix. The modality mismatch leads to drop-off even when motivation is high. Addressing this constraint is key to avoiding solutions that look good on paper but don’t get used.  
**Why included:** Prevents a common false solution; centers real-world habit friction; informs practical design constraints.

</details>

### Unselected Problems

#### Domain 5 — Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms

<details>
<summary>Forming effective pairs without data (Problem 5.1)</summary>
Valuable, but narrower leverage than establishing consistent data/insight flows; also benefits from resolving 5.3 first.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Classroom workflow slows the activity (Problem 5.2)</summary>
Important, yet validation requires real classroom access and co-design time—high coordination cost for a short timeline.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hard to capture outcomes at scale (Problem 5.3)</summary>
High impact but heavy (privacy, approvals, multi-site consistency); better as a longer-term effort than a two–three-week build.
</details>

#### Domain 7 — Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships

<details>
<summary>Losing track of recent contact (Problem 7.1)</summary>
Meaningful, but outside the immediate focus on reflection habits; likely to require multi-app integrations to shine.
</details>

<details>
<summary>No clear sense of weekly social bandwidth (Problem 7.2)</summary>
Useful, but depends on modeling time/energy from calendars and routines—non-trivial for a short prototype.
</details>

<details>
<summary>No differentiation of connectedness levels (Problem 7.3)</summary>
Valuable conceptually, but needs prolonged calibration with real usage to avoid over- or under-prioritizing ties.
</details>

## Stakeholders

### Shared stakeholder set (applies to Problems 1.1–1.3)

1. **The Journaler (primary user)** — Individual building and maintaining a reflection habit and acting on insights.
2. **Collaborators & Close Relationships (non-users)** — Classmates/teammates, friends, roommates/housemates who benefit when the journaler is reliable and focused (or are affected when they aren’t).
3. **Support Network & Professionals (non-users)** — Therapists, coaches, advisors, mentors, or parents focused on wellbeing, follow-through, and healthy routines.

### Impact on Stakeholders: Who’s Affected and How?

<details>
<summary><b>Reflection slips when I’m busy (Problem 1.1)</b></summary>

- **The Journaler:** When reflection gets skipped during busy periods, planning weakens and follow-through drops; the habit becomes fragile and progress feels unclear.
- **Collaborators & Close Relationships:** Missed or late commitments and more reactive communication create friction in shared tasks or living arrangements. Reliability improves when the journaler maintains a simple, consistent cadence.
- **Support Network & Professionals:** Inconsistent inputs make it harder to spot emerging issues, celebrate wins, or tailor guidance; steadier entries enable earlier, more targeted support.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hard to see patterns across entries (Problem 1.2)</b></summary>

- **The Journaler:** Without surfaced trends (recurring stressors, effective routines, goal progress), entries stay siloed and opportunities to adjust are missed. Clear patterns enable concrete next steps and better prioritization.
- **Collaborators & Close Relationships:** When the journaler can translate patterns into plans, scheduling becomes more predictable and last-minute churn for others decreases.
- **Support Network & Professionals:** Synthesized themes help sessions focus on decisions and experiments instead of repeatedly rediscovering issues from scratch.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Digital journaling doesn’t lower friction (and can distract) (Problem 1.3)</b></summary>

- **The Journaler:** Typing—especially on a phone near bedtime—adds friction and distraction, reducing adherence and potentially harming sleep; habit benefits are lost when tools increase effort.
- **Collaborators & Close Relationships:** Next-day preparedness can suffer (scattered plans, slower follow-through), which ripples into team work and shared responsibilities.
- **Support Network & Professionals:** If the modality increases friction and gets abandoned, there’s less trustworthy data to inform coaching/therapy and track progress over time.

</details>

## Evidence & Comparables

### (Problem 1.1) Reflection slips when I’m busy

**TL;DR:** Small, structured reflection meaningfully improves outcomes; however, under time pressure,intentions evaporate without scaffolding. Most journals and reflection tools still require users to initiate reflections which is where adherence collapses on hectic days.

#### Evidence

<details>
<summary><b>Reflecting (≈15 min/day) improves performance.</b></summary>
   
A call-center field experiment found trainees who spent time reflecting outperformed controls on final assessments, highlighting that even small, regular reflection yields benefits.

<details>
<summary><b>If-then plans boost follow-through.</b></summary>
A comprehensive meta-analysis shows _implementation intentions_ (“If it’s 10 pm, then I journal for 3 minutes”) produce medium–large gains in goal attainment—useful for making the habit resilient when life gets busy.

### (Problem 1.2) Hard to see patterns across entries

**TL;DR:** Often times the amount of data captured is plentiful, however synthesis is scarce. Currently, reflection tools only surface patterns after the user manually introduces their own schemas and tags. The process of labeling reflections for synthesis introduces its own friction, overshadowing the high level reflections the labels enable with extra work.

#### Evidence

<details>
<summary><b>Stage-Based Model: barriers at “integration” & “reflection.”</b></summary>

Foundational HCI work shows people struggle to aggregate and interpret their self-data—exactly the step from scattered entries → actionable trends.

### (Problem 1.3) Digital journaling doesn’t lower friction (and can distract)

**TL;DR:** Digitizing reflections is useful, but method matters. Phone-based typing often retains the friction of writing and, at night, adds attentional and sleep costs. Because screens and notifications invite distraction, prefer low-screen capture (brief voice notes, scan-to-text/Optical Character Recognition) if the goal is to reduce friction while keeping entries searchable.

#### Evidence

<details>
<summary><b>Evening screens can disrupt sleep.</b></summary>

Harvard Health explains how blue-light exposure at night can delay melatonin and shift circadian timing—risking poorer sleep when journaling on phones at bedtime.  
[Harvard Health Letter — _Blue light has a dark side_ (PDF)](https://www.drhodesod.com/uploads/4/1/4/3/41435373/harvard_medical_news_blue_light_has_a_dark_side_%281%29.pdf).
