# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains

### Brainstorm

<details>

1. **Personal Reflection & Habit-Building**  
   I care about regular reflection but run into friction: remembering to journal, carving out the time, and not having a quick way to review past entries or pull higher-level insights from them. Writing often feels like an extra task. I want a lightweight, structured way to capture thoughts daily and see patterns over time without it feeling like another task.

2. **Student-to-Student Campus Exchange**  
   At Harvard, students often use dorm email lists and send slide decks of items to sell, which creates a flood of “spammy” emails at the start and end of terms. They do this because trading with other Harvard students feels safer and easier than Facebook Marketplace. I’d like a campus-bounded way to discover, vet, and exchange items quickly—without inbox overload.

3. **Using Shared Dorm Amenities Without Guesswork**  
   Harvard recently switched to the _On Tap Away_ app to manage laundry, but it misses the mark: it doesn’t address the trial-and-error timing problem, especially when our building has just six machines (3 washers & 3 dryers) for 70+ people. I want earlier, more actionable signals about availability so I can plan my time instead of gambling it.

4. **Coordinating Casual Social Meals**  
   I love spontaneous meals with friends, but lining up time and place is harder than it should be. Group chats sprawl and good intentions fizzle. I want a simple, low-friction way to surface availability and interest without back-and-forth.

5. **Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms**  
   I’m interested in pedagogy and have seen peer-to-peer activities help, but pairing and facilitation are often ad-hoc. Beyond helping teachers set up effective pairs/groups, I want to enable researchers to access large-scale classroom data so the impact of different pedagogies can actually be measured.

6. **Sharing Learning Artifacts Among Students**  
   Classes generate tons of notes and summaries, yet high-quality material is scattered and hard to trust. Motivated students produce great resources that don’t travel. I want a reliable way to find, credit, and iteratively improve study materials.

7. **Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships**  
   I genuinely like hanging out and staying in touch, but in the hustle and bustle I forget to maintain relationships or they fall off my radar. I want gentle structure to keep friendships top-of-mind with supportive nudges.

8. **Discovering & Enrolling in Enrichment Programs**  
   Families struggle to find after-school and summer options; information is fragmented and popular programs fill fast. The search and waitlist process feels opaque. I want clearer discovery and enrollment paths, especially for oversubscribed programs.

9. **Learning User Research by Doing**  
   When students hear about user interviews the rarely are able to practice under realistic conditions. During my gap year I taught user research as a way to explore the world and build user-centric solutions; a tool here could expand that reach and give teachers a creative on-ramp to design thinking. I want experiential practice with feedback that connects insights to solution quality and viability.

10. **Teacher-to-Teacher Curriculum Sharing & Adaptation**  
    Teachers reinvent materials constantly, yet good resources are hard to find, vet, and adapt. Inspired by Scratch’s "Remix" culture - communities that iterate, learn, and share - I want materials to travel and evolve with clear attribution and quality signals.

### Most Promising

#### **Personal Reflection & Habit-Building**

I find it genuinely helpful to take a moment each day to reflect on what happened and plan what I want to do tomorrow. But there’s real friction: I sometimes forget to journal, when I’m busy it’s one of the first habits I abandon because it “takes too much time,” and with a written journal it’s hard to spot high-level patterns across days. I’m curious whether new AI tools could lower the effort of reflection and still unlock the benefits, like actionable to-dos and higher-level insights, without the usual pain.

#### **Making Peer Learning Work in Real Classrooms**

I’m deeply interested in education and pedagogy, and I’ve seen peer activities help; however, pairing and facilitation often feel ad-hoc, especially in under-resourced classrooms. I’m drawn to this domain because it’s hard for educators and researchers to access enough real-world data to evaluate which approaches work best at scale. I want to understand how to support peer learning more intentionally and make it easier to study its impact rigorously.

#### **Maintaining Intentional In-Person Friendships**

I care about staying close with people I value - meeting up, calling, FaceTiming, or even sending a quick “thinking of you” text - but in the rush of school and life, relationships slip out of focus. The friction is remembering who I haven’t connected with recently and finding low-effort ways to reach out that feel natural, not performative or guilt-inducing. I’m interested in light weight scaffolds that keep relationships top-of-mind and make it easier to initiate and sustain meaningful touchpoints.
