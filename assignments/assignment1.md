### Most Promising

#### **Phone Journaling**

I’m drawn to this idea because it combines reflection, habit-building, and AI in a novel way. Unlike traditional journaling apps, this tool makes the process conversational by scheduling a daily phone call where the AI guides the user through a structured journal entry. By asking the same or predefined questions each day, the app can track responses over time and generate insights such as trends or actionable to-do lists. This addresses a real barrier many people face: actually sitting down to write, while also helping build a consistent reflection practice.

#### **Data-Driven Peer-to-Peer Learning Tools**

This idea reflects my interest in education and pedagogy, particularly in how classrooms can be structured so that peer-to-peer learning activities promote deeper understanding in under-resourced schools. A platform that helps teachers pair students based on strengths and weaknesses could make peer-to-peer models like Think-Pair-Share far more effective and data-backed. This is an issue I’ve encountered in my own informal research, where I’ve seen how difficult it is for education researchers to gather meaningful data about the effectiveness of peer-to-peer learning at scale. Even a basic prototype could support both classroom practice and educational research.

#### **Social CRM for In-Person Interactions**

I’m interested in this idea because technology has made it easy to stay connected online, yet it is still hard to maintain intentional offline relationships. A “social CRM” would track the health of friendships, nudge users to reach out to people they haven’t connected with recently, and encourage meaningful in-person interactions. I see this as a way of using software not to replace social life, but to strengthen it, making it easier to prioritize friendships in the midst of busy student schedules.
